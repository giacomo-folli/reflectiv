## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended) for running locally or for some build steps.
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for running with Docker.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually comes with Docker Desktop) for the recommended Docker setup.

### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

#### Quick Start: Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd monthly-reflection-diary
```

2. Create your environment configuration by copying the example `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit the `.env` file. For more details on available variables, see the '### Environment Configuration' section below. At a minimum, you should set:
   - A strong `SESSION_SECRET` (for production)
   - Your `OPENAI_API_KEY` if using AI features
   - Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your domain in production

4. Build and start the Docker container:

```bash
# Build and start in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d

# View logs if needed
docker-compose logs -f
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Advanced: Running with Docker Directly

```bash
# Build the optimized multi-stage Docker image
docker build -t reflection-diary .

# Run the container with appropriate environment variables
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_here \
  -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -v reflection_diary_data:/app/data \
  -d reflection-diary
```

### Method 2: Using Node.js Locally

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd monthly-reflection-diary
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Configure Environment Variables
Before running the application, you'll need to set up your environment variables. Copy the example file by running `cp .env.example .env`. Then, customize the `.env` file with your specific settings. Refer to the main '### Environment Configuration' section below for details on the variables.

#### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Run the production build locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Environment Configuration

Regardless of how you run the application, environment variables are key for configuration.

1. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of your project. If you haven't created one yet, copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your specific configuration:
   - Set a strong `SESSION_SECRET` for production. This is critical for securing user sessions.
   - Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're planning to use features that interact with the OpenAI API.
   - For Docker, ensure `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set, especially for production deployments.
   - Modify other settings as needed for database paths, ports, etc.

## üß™ Test Credentials

For local development and testing, you can use these credentials:

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works: A Technical Deep Dive

### Project Structure

Understanding the project's layout will help you navigate the codebase. This SvelteKit project uses a standard structure that clearly separates frontend and backend concerns:

- **`src/`**: Contains all the core application code.
  - **`app.html`**: The main HTML template for all pages.
  - **`hooks.client.ts`**: Client-side hooks.
  - **`hooks.server.ts`**: Server-side hooks (e.g., for authentication, request handling).
  - **`lib/`**: Libraries, utilities, and components.
    - **`components/`**: Reusable Svelte components (frontend). These are building blocks for the UI.
    - **`client/`**: Client-specific code (this code only runs in the user's browser).
      - **`utils/`**: Utilities that are only used in the browser (e.g., PDF generation, toast notifications, Svelte transitions).
      - **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions for client-specific data structures.
    - **`server/`**: Backend-specific code. This code only runs on the server and is never exposed to the client.
      - **`auth.ts`**: Authentication logic (password hashing, session management).
      - **`db.ts`**: Database interaction logic (SQLite setup, queries).
      - _(Potentially `utils/` or other subdirectories for server-specific utilities)_
    - **`types/`**: Shared TypeScript type definitions used by both client and server (e.g., API types, core domain types like User, Link).
    - **`utils/`**: Utility functions that can be used by both client-side and server-side code (e.g., date formatting, validation).
    - **`i18n/`**: Internationalization setup and locale files.
  - **`routes/`**: Defines the application's pages and API endpoints. SvelteKit uses a file-system based router, so the structure of this directory dictates your app's URLs.
    - **`+page.svelte`**: Svelte components for pages (frontend).
    - **`+page.server.ts`**: Server-side load functions for pages (backend logic for fetching data).
    - **`+layout.svelte`**: Svelte components for layouts (frontend).
    - **`+layout.server.ts`**: Server-side load functions for layouts (backend).
    - **`api/`**: Defines API endpoints.
      - **`[endpoint]/+server.ts`**: Server-side handlers for API routes (backend).
- **`static/`**: Static assets (e.g., images, fonts) that are served directly.
- **`scripts/`**: Standalone Node.js scripts for development and operational tasks (e.g., `db-tools.js` for database management). These are not part of the client bundle.
- **`.env` / `.env.example`**: Environment variable configuration.
- **`svelte.config.js`**: SvelteKit configuration.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Vite bundler configuration.

### Data Persistence

The application uses SQLite for data persistence:

1. User data, sessions, and links are stored in a SQLite database.
2. The database file is located in the `./data` directory by default.
3. The location can be configured with the `DATA_DIR` environment variable.
4. When using Docker, the database is persisted using a named Docker volume (see Docker Specifics section).

#### Database Management

The application includes a database management tool for common tasks:

```bash
# View database information and user accounts
node scripts/db-tools.js info

# Export database contents as JSON
node scripts/db-tools.js export

# Reset the database (removes all data)
node scripts/db-tools.js reset
```

For production environments with higher traffic, you might want to:

1. Consider upgrading to a more robust database solution like PostgreSQL.
2. Implement database migrations for schema changes.
3. Enhance the authentication mechanisms with additional security features.

### Authentication

Authentication currently uses simple session-based cookies:

- For local development, the test credentials above will work.
- In production, implement proper password hashing and user management. (Note: The `auth.ts` file includes password hashing.)

### PDF Generation

The app uses jsPDF to generate reflection diary PDFs:

- Each PDF includes daily reflection questions.
- Customize the questions in `src/routes/api/generate-pdf/+server.js`.

### Docker Specifics

#### Docker Data Persistence

The application stores data in a Docker volume when run with Docker:

- Data is stored in the named volume `reflection_diary_data`.
- The volume persists across container restarts and rebuilds.
- Backup the volume for production deployments:

```bash
# Backup the database volume
docker run --rm -v reflection_diary_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/reflection_diary_backup.tar.gz /data

# Restore from a backup
docker run --rm -v reflection_diary_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  sh -c "rm -rf /data/* && tar xzf /backup/reflection_diary_backup.tar.gz -C /"
```

#### Health Checks & Monitoring

The Docker setup includes:

- Automatic health checks at `/health` endpoint.
- Container restart policy for fault tolerance.
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Log rotation to manage disk space.
