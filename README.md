**Monthly Reflection Diary** is an open source app to help you collect and organize meaningful conversations and links‚Äîlike your chats with ChatGPT‚Äîand generate monthly PDF reflection diaries from them.

This is my first fullstack project using **Node.js, Docker, and SQLite**, and I'm a **junior developer** learning as I build. It‚Äôs a big personal project and I‚Äôm excited to share it!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is a personal reflection tool, **not a substitute for professional help**. If you're struggling, please consider reaching out to a counselor, therapist, or a trusted friend. You're not alone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

You can run the app either with **Docker** (recommended) or using **Node.js locally**.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giacomo-folli/reflectiv.git
cd reflectiv
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required:**

- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: The base URL where your application is accessible. For local use, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.

**AI Features:**

The application can leverage AI services for enhanced functionality. If you wish to use these features, you'll need to configure the following:

- `AI_SERVICE_PROVIDER`: Specify the AI service you want to use. Options are:
    - `"openai"`
    - `"gemini"`
    - `"claude"`
- Corresponding API Key:
    - If `AI_SERVICE_PROVIDER="openai"`, set `OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"`
    - If `AI_SERVICE_PROVIDER="gemini"`, set `GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"`
    - If `AI_SERVICE_PROVIDER="claude"`, set `CLAUDE_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here"`

### 3. Start the app

#### Option A: With Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Option B: Locally with Node.js

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

This project is continuously evolving, and we're excited about the future! We are actively working on expanding its capabilities and making it even more versatile for our users.

Our roadmap includes:

-   **Broader LLM Support:** We plan to integrate a wider range of Large Language Models to give you more choices. This includes upcoming support for:
    -   OpenAI's GPT models
    -   Anthropic's Claude

We believe in community-driven development. If you're interested in contributing to these features, or if you have other ideas and suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out or open an issue. Your input is highly valued!
